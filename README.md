# C++ Projects 🔥

A collection of C++ programs, exercises, and projects for learning and practicing C++ programming concepts.

## 📖 Description

This repository contains various C++ implementations including:
- Basic programming concepts and syntax
- Data structures and algorithms
- Object-oriented programming examples
- STL (Standard Template Library) usage
- Design patterns and best practices

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- C++ compiler (GCC, Clang, or MSVC)
- Code editor or IDE (VS Code, Visual Studio, Code::Blocks, etc.)
- Basic understanding of programming concepts

### Installation
1. Clone or download this repository
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Compile and run individual programs as needed

## 🔨 Compilation

### Using GCC
```bash
g++ -o program program.cpp
./program
```

### Using Visual Studio
```bash
cl program.cpp
program.exe
```

### With C++17/20 standards
```bash
g++ -std=c++17 -o program program.cpp
g++ -std=c++20 -o program program.cpp
```
